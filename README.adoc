= Welcome To The Full-Stack Starter Project

This project will assist you in building the critical skills necessary to complete tasks concerning both the
Front-End and Back-End of a web application.

. Please follow the instructions on the https://gogs.caifos.us/Sofiac/incubator-documentation/src/branch/master/fullstack[Incubator Full Stack Docs]
to get your environment setup.
. Clone this repository to your environment `git@gogs.caifos.us:Sofiac/fullstack-starter.git`

== Back-End

. Before anything else, we need to populate our local databases with the sample data.For your convenience, we
have included a script that will automatically import the json data for you, so all you need to do is run
it.From the fullstack-starter root directory, enter the following command: `./sample-data/import.sh`

. Next `cd` into the starter directory

. In order to run the web application, we need to compile, or "build", the data objects and classes from the
back-end.Enter the following command: `mvn clean install`

. Next, we are ready to run the back-end of the application.Enter the following command: `mvn spring-boot:run`

=== Front-End

. In a new terminal window, navigate back to the fullstack-starter root directory
. Next, `cd` into the ui directory
. In order to run the front-end, we must first resolve any dependencies that the project relies on.Enter the
following command: `yarn`

. After the dependencies have been resolved, we are ready to run the front-end of the application.In the
same directory, enter the following command: `yarn start`
. Lastly, to view the operating front-end, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your preferred
browser.
